## ❓ What is a Polymorphic Virus?

A **polymorphic virus** is a type of **malicious software** that changes its code appearance every time it runs or spreads. Even though its **behavior stays the same**, the code looks different on each execution.  
This concept is important for **defensive research**, because it helps security analysts study how malware evades simple signature-based detection and why modern detection relies on **behavior, heuristics, and runtime analysis** instead of static patterns.

*Note: This project is strictly for learning, research, and defensive understanding.*
