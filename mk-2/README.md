# In-memory basic polymorphic virus...............

---

## ✨ Features (Conceptual Simulation)

- 🌐 Simulated remote input loading (represents how malware might fetch data)

- 🧠 Memory-only execution model (for understanding in-memory behavior)

- 🧩 Illustrates low-level API flow seen in advanced threats

- 🧬 5 polymorphic transformation engines + junk mixing

- 🔄 Shows how payload structure can shift each run

- 🛡️ Built for learning defensive + analytical techniques
